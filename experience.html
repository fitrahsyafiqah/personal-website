<p>During my diploma I had my internship program at the Jabatan Imigresen Malaysia Negeri Kelantan for 5 months. I was placed at the department of administration service. A lot of things I learned from my internship program that related to the course that i studied which is Diploma in Secretarial Science. All the experience that I had from my internship program can be guidance for me when I work in future.</p>

<p>I also used to work as a part-timer worker as promoter at the JELAJAH PANTAI TIMUR organized by the Prestige Sport Company. I was work at there for 5 days. From there I got a lot of new things that I learned which is I know how to communicate with the customers, also how to serve the customers and I learned about how to choose the right shoes according to the activities that we are doing.</p>
